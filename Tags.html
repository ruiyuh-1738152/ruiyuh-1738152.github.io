	   <h2>About me</h2>
	   <p>My name is Cindy Hao and I am from China. I am passinate about cultural diversity.</p>
	   <p>Additionally, reading romantic stories is also one of my interests. My favorite book is Gone With the Wind. The heroine in this book is Scarlett. I admire her strength, her courage, and her energy.</p>
	   <p>This is my first year in UW and my intended major is economics. I have never had a class writing code to build a website like this one, but I think this class is fine and does not seem to be a challenge for me.</p>
