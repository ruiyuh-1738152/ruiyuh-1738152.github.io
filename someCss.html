	   <p style="font-family:courier;">For me, Seattle gives me a feeling that it seems so similar but also a bit mysterious. Raining is the most common thing every day. I thought I may hate raining before I came to there. However, raining becomes something I am used to and it makes feel comfortable. Plus, I love the cherry blossom so much.

       <p style="font-family:Times new roman;">After reading plenty of romantic stories, I decided to write my own fiction. I created the main characters, worked hard on the plots, and refined so many times. During the past year, I completed five chapters, but the thing is now I have to stop writing because I don't believe the story I came up with anymore. Story is based on the combination of imagination and reality, so when imagination accounts for the larger portion, it is impossible to make the story successful.</p>
